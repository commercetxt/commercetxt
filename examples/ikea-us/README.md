## 🎯 What is CommerceTXT?

CommerceTXT is a lightweight, text-based protocol designed for AI/LLM consumption of e-commerce data. It eliminates JSON overhead while maintaining structure and readability.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **24% fewer tokens** than JSON (3.6M saved including catalog structure)
- ✅ **Human-readable** - easy to debug and version control
- ✅ **AI-optimized** - clean format for RAG and LLM processing
- ✅ **Structured** - parseable with simple rules

result = parse_file("products/frames/00263858.txt")

# Access structured data
product = result.directives.get('PRODUCT', {})
offer = result.directives.get('OFFER', {})

print(f"Product: {product.get('Name')}")
print(f"Price: ${offer.get('Price')}")
print(f"Brand: {product.get('Brand')}")
```

## 💰 Token Efficiency

**CommerceTXT vs JSON Comparison:**

> **Clarification:** Disclaimer section is not included in any of the token counts or savings calculations.


| Component | JSON Tokens | CommerceTXT Tokens | Savings |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Products (30,511)** | 14,894,623 | 10,212,452 | 31.44% |
| **Categories (632)** | N/A* | 1,073,051 | - |
| **Root Catalog** | N/A* | 11,180 | - |
| **TOTAL** | **14,894,623** | **11,296,683** | **24.16%** |

\* JSON has no built-in catalog structure (requires separate database/index)

**Per Product Average:**
- JSON: 488 tokens/product
- CommerceTXT: 370 tokens/product (including catalog overhead)
- **Savings: 118 tokens/product (24%)**

**Cost Impact (GPT-4o at $2.50/1M input tokens):**
- 1 query/day: **$269/month saved**
- 10 queries/day: **$2,690/month saved**
- 100 queries/day: **$26,900/month saved**

> **Note:** CommerceTXT includes structured navigation via `@CATALOG` and category files, which JSON lacks. Categories list all products, adding ~1.08M tokens. Even with this catalog overhead, CommerceTXT saves **3.6M tokens (24%)**!

## 🔍 Use Cases

### 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
```python
# Load products into vector database
# Query: "Find affordable black frames"
# Retrieve relevant .txt files
# Pass to LLM for response generation
```

### 2. Product Search
```python
# Semantic search across 30K products
# Token-efficient context for LLM ranking
# Real-time price/availability lookup
```

### 3. AI Shopping Assistant
```python
# Natural language product queries
# Compare products efficiently
# Generate recommendations
```

## 📊 Token Savings Distribution

**Product-level savings distribution (30,511 products):**

When comparing individual products (JSON → CommerceTXT), before adding catalog overhead:

```
  0-10%:    111 products (0.4%)
 10-20%:  5,934 products (19.4%)
 20-30%: 10,018 products (32.8%)  ← Most common
 30-40%: 10,433 products (34.2%)  ← Most common
 40-50%:  3,239 products (10.6%)
   >50%:    776 products (2.5%)
```

**Product average:** ~31% savings per product  
**Dataset total (with catalog):** 24% savings overall

> **Note:** Individual products save ~31% on average, but the full dataset (including 632 category files with product listings) saves 24% overall. The catalog structure adds navigation value that JSON lacks.

## 🛠️ Generation

This dataset was generated from the original IKEA US JSON data by converting it to CommerceTXT v1.0.1 format.

**Conversion process:**
1. Parsed JSON from [source dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jeffreyszhou/ikea-us-products-2025)
2. Extracted clean product names (removed measurements, IKEA US suffix)
3. Organized products into 632 category folders
4. Converted to CommerceTXT structured format
5. Generated category index files with full product listings
6. Created root @CATALOG with all 632 categories
7. Validated all 30,511 product files for spec compliance

**Conversion tools:** Available in the [CommerceTXT repository](https://github.com/commercetxt/commercetxt/tree/main/examples/ikea-us)
